##💡 Inspiration💡
We wanted to increase our status on social media hence we made this chrome extension that allows us to do just that on linkedin!

## ⚙️ What it does ⚙️
We have a chrome extension that allows you to use AI-generated responses to LinkedIn posts, and it is built right into LinkedIn! After adding the extension, whenever the user visits LinkedIn, there is a button embedded in the end of every post. All the user has to do is click the button and the post’s text will be sent to the Golang server, and the AI-generated response will be put in the comment textbox of the post. The user can then check the response, tweak it if wanted, and have a sensible response to send quickly and right on LinkedIn. 

## 🏗️ How we built it 🏗️
We used Go lang and Cohere for backend along with a chrome extension that made HTTP requests to the Go lang server and got the appropriate response for the comment, then this response is injected onto linkedin and can be posted!

## 🟣Cohere Gin server in Golang 🟣
The server was made using Go lang and we used Cohere to generate responses for our social media posts. We made the chrome extension use POST requests to send the comment and in return it got the response that was generated by the Cohere model we used. 

## 🔴Chrome Extension in Javascript 🔴
The chrome extension injects customized HTML buttons to each post, and after fetching AI-generated responses from the server, the extension injects the response in the LinkedIn comment box. We used Javascript query selectors and had to look through the extensive HTML tree of LinkedIn to figure out where to identify the texts of the posts and where to inject responses into the comment boxes. 

## 🚩 Challenges we ran into
There are no tutorials that tell us about the LinkedIn HTML tree, so we had to figure a lot parts on that end by ourselves when creating the code that the extension injects.
A lot of errors when trying to make HTTP requests because of "cors" and lack of use of headers
We were also learning how to use Go lang from scratch along with how to make a chrome web extension even though we were completely new to what we were using this weekend we made pretty good progress

## 🥇 Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of having created a chrome extension that works directly on a website. We are also proud that we could incorporate so much new technology in such little time.

## 📚 What we learned
We learned how to create Chrome extensions and how to customize them. We were always curios about how to create chrome extensions. We learned how to use go lang as it is something we are doing for the 1st time.

## ⏳ What's next for ?
We are planning to make it available to more social medias such as instagram, twitter, and more!
